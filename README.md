# ASMA
## Problem Description
The model implemented in proj2 explores the stability of a predator-prey ecosystem involving Sheep, Wolves and Grass. Our objective is to monitor the evolution and stability of the ecosystem over time. 
Such a system is called unstable if it tends to result in extinction for one or more species involved. In contrast, a system is stable if it tends to maintain itself over time, despite fluctuations in population sizes. The model was implemented using Mesa, a agent-based modeling framework for Python. 

## System Variables
### Independent Variables
-Initial number of Sheep, wolves and grass\
-Energy gained by sheep for each unity of grass eaten\
-Energy gained by wolves for each sheep eaten\
-Probability of reproduction (wolves and sheep)\
-Amount of grass that grows by step\
-Starting energy (wolves and sheep)
### Dependent Variables
-Number of sheep per step\
-Number of wolves per step\
-Number of grass per step
